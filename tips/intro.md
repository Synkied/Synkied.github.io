# Introduction

The most important part of being a good programmer is not knowing how to code, but knowing how to code well. This means being able to write code that is easily readable, maintainable and debuggable. The best way to learn how to do this is by reading other people's code, trying to understand the design decisions they made and the problems they faced.

The problem is, most of us don't have the time or the resources to read every single line of code ever written, and that's where these tips come in handy. They are a collection of the best practices, common pitfalls and tips from my experience in the field, all in one place.
